# magnetic_classification

The folder magnetic_ordering includes source code and pretrained models of magnetic order classification. To retrain the model, first download the data from materials project using preload_data/download_structures.ipynb, then run python script magnetic_ordering.py. To load the pretrained models in folder trained_model, run python script loadmodel.py.

The folder prop_vector includes source code and pretrained models of propagation vector classification. To retrain the model, run python script prop_vector.py.
